			<p class="x03-Chapter-Epigraph">“I can’t call a person a hard worker just because I hear they read and write, even if working at it all night. Until I know what a person is working for, I can’t deem them industrious.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. I <em>can</em> if the end they work for is their own ruling principle, having it be and remain in constant harmony with Nature.”</p>
