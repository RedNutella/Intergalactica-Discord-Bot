			<p class="x03-Chapter-Epigraph">“You know what wine and liqueur tastes like. It makes no difference whether a hundred or a thousand bottles pass through your bladder—you are nothing more than a filter.”</p>

			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">H</span>ere we have another contemptuous expression, this time from Seneca, who, given his reputation for opulence, probably enjoyed a nice drink from time to time. His point will probably rattle anyone for whom success and adulthood has turned them into a wine snob (though the logic can be applied just as easily to foodies, techies, audiophiles, and the like).</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As fun and exciting and pleasurable as these pleasures are, it’s worth putting them in their place. You don’t get a prize at the end of your life for having consumed more, worked more, spent more, collected more, or learned more about the various vintages than everyone else. You are just a conduit, a vessel that temporarily held or interacted with these fancy items.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">If you find yourself lusting over them, this meditation might help reduce their luster just a smidge.</p>
