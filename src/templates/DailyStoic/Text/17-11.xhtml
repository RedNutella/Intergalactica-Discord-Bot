			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">R</span>emember, the proper direction of philosophy—of all the things we’re doing here—is focused inward. To make <em>ourselves</em> better and to leave other people to that task for themselves and their own journey. Our faults are in our control, and so we turn to philosophy to help scrape them off like barnacles from the hull of a ship. Other people’s faults? Not so much. That’s for them to do.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Leave other people to their faults. Nothing in Stoic philosophy empowers you to judge them—only to accept them. Especially when we have so many of our own.</p>
