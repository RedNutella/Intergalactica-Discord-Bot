			<p class="x03-Chapter-Epigraph">“Hurry to your own ruling reason, to the reason of the Whole, and to your neighbor’s. To your own mind to make it just; to the mind of the Whole to remember your place in it; and to your neighbor’s mind to learn whether it’s ignorant or of sound knowledge—while recognizing it’s like yours.”</p>

It also happens that these are the instances that we’re mostly likely to regret.</p>
