			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">O</span>n tough days we might say, “My work is overwhelming,” or “My boss is really frustrating.” If only we could understand that this is impossible. Someone can’t frustrate <em>you</em>, work can’t overwhelm <em>you</em>—these are external objects, and they have no access to your mind. Those emotions you feel, as real as they are, come from the inside, not the outside.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The Stoics use the word <em>hypolêpsis</em>, which means “taking up”—of perceptions, thoughts, and judgments by our mind. What we assume, what we willingly generate in our mind, that’s on us. We can’t blame other people for making us feel stressed or frustrated any more than we can blame them for our jealousy. The cause is within us. They’re just the target.</p>
