			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">W</span>e almost always know <em>what</em> the right thing is. We know we should not get upset, that we shouldn’t take this personally, that we should walk to the health food store instead of swinging by the drive-through, that we need to sit down and focus for an hour. The tougher part is deciding to do it in a given moment.</p>

As he put it in <em>The War of Art</em>, “We don’t tell ourselves, ‘I’m never going to write my symphony.’ Instead we say, ‘I’m going to write my symphony; I’m just going to start tomorrow.’”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Today, not tomorrow, is the day that we can start to be good.</p>
