			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">M</span>arcus’s meditations are filled with self-criticism and so are the writings of other Stoics. It’s important to remember, however, that that’s as far as it goes. There was no self-flagellation, no paying penance, no self-esteem issues from guilt or self-loathing. You never hear them call themselves worthless pieces of crap, nor do they ever starve or cut themselves as punishment. Their self-criticism is <em>constructive</em>.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Laying into yourself, unduly depriving yourself, punishing yourself—that’s self-flagellation, not self-improvement.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">No need to be too hard on yourself. Hold yourself to a higher standard but not an impossible one. And forgive yourself if and when you slip up.</p>
