Although total strangers know endless amounts of trivia about them, celebrities—because they are too busy or because it hurts too much—appear to know very little about themselves.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">We can be guilty of the same sin. We ignore Socrates’s dictum to “know thyself”—often realizing we have done so at our peril, years later, when we wake up one day and realize how rarely we have asked ourselves questions like: <em>Who am I? What’s important to me? What do I like? What do I</em> <em>need?</em></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Now—right now—you have the time to explore yourself, to understand your own mind and body. Don’t wait. Know yourself. Before it’s impossibly late.</p>
