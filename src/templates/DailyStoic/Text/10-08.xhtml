			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">P</span>sychologists speak of cognitive distortions—exaggerated thinking patterns that have a destructive impact on the life of the patient. One of the most common is known as all-or-nothing thinking (also referred to as splitting). Examples of this include thoughts like:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">If you’re not with me, you’re against me.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">So-and-so is all good/bad.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">Because this wasn’t a complete success, it is a total failure.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This sort of extreme thinking is associated with depression and frustration. How could it not be? Perfectionism rarely begets perfection—only disappointment.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Pragmatism has no such hang-ups. It’ll take what it can get. That’s what Epictetus is reminding us. We’re never going to be perfect—if there is even such a thing. We’re human, after all. Our pursuits should be aimed at progress, however little that it’s possible for us to make.</p>
