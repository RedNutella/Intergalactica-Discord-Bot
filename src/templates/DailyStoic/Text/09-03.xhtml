			<p class="x03-Chapter-Epigraph">“Above all, keep a close watch on this—that you are never so tied to your former acquaintances and friends that you are pulled down to their level. If you don’t, you’ll be ruined.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. You must choose whether to be loved by these friends and remain the same person, or to become a better person at the cost of those friends&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. if you try to have it both ways you will neither make progress nor keep what you once had.”</p>

			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">J</span>im Rohn’s widely quoted line is: “You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.” James Altucher advises young writers and entrepreneurs to find their “scene”—a group of peers who push them to be better. Your father might have given you a warning when he saw you spending time with some bad kids: “Remember, you become like your friends.” One of Goethe’s maxims captures it better: “Tell me with whom you consort and I will tell you who you are.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Consciously consider whom you allow into your life—not like some snobby elitist but like someone who is trying to cultivate the best life possible. Ask yourself about the people you meet and spend time with: <em>Are they making me better? Do they encourage me to push forward and hold me accountable? Or do they drag me down to their level?</em> Now, with this in mind, ask the most important question: <em>Should I spend more or less time with these folks?</em></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The second part of Goethe’s quote tells us the stakes of this choice: “If I know how you spend your time,” he said, “then I know what might become of you.”</p>
