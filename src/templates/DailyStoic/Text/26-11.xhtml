			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">W</span>hat’s the difference between you and the richest person in the world? One has a little more money than the other. What’s the difference between you and the oldest person in the world? One has been around a little longer than the other. Same goes for the tallest, smartest, fastest, and on down the line.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Measuring ourselves against other people makes acceptance difficult, because we want what <em>they</em> have, or we want how things <em>could</em> have gone, not what we happen to have. But that makes no difference.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Some might see this line from Marcus as pessimistic, whereas others see it as optimistic. It’s really just <em>truth</em>. We’re all here and we’re all going to leave this earth eventually, so let’s not concern ourselves with petty differences in the meantime. We have too much to do.</p>
