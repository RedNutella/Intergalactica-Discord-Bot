			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">T</span>hink of the manic people in your life. Not the ones suffering from an unfortunate disorder, but the ones whose lives and choices are <em>in</em> disorder. Everything is soaring highs or crushing lows; the day is either amazing or awful. Aren’t those people exhausting? Don’t you wish they just had a filter through which they could test the good impulses versus the bad ones?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">There is such a filter. Justice. Reason. Philosophy. If there’s a central message of Stoic thought, it’s this: impulses of all kinds are going to come, and your work is to control them, like bringing a dog to heel. Put more simply: think before you act. Ask: <em>Who is in control here? What principles are guiding me?</em></p>
