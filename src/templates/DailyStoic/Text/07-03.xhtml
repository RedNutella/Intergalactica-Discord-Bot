			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">S</span>elf-awareness is the ability to objectively evaluate the self. It’s the ability to question our own instincts, patterns, and assumptions. <em>Oiêsis</em>, self-deception or arrogant and unchallenged opinion, requires that we hold all our opinions up to hard scrutiny; even our eyes deceive us.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">On the one hand, that’s alarming. <em>I can’t even trust my own senses?! </em>Sure, you could think about it that way. Or you could take it another way: because our senses are often wrong, our emotions overly alarmed, our projections overly optimistic, we’re better off not rushing into conclusions about anything. We can take a beat with everything we do and become aware of everything that’s going on so we can make the right decision.</p>
