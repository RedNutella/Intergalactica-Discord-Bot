			<p class="x03-Chapter-Epigraph">“When the standards have been set, things are tested and weighed. And the work of philosophy is just this, to examine and uphold the standards, but the work of a truly good person is in using those standards when they know them.”</p>

			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">W</span>e go through our days responding and reacting, but it’s rare to really pause and ask: <em>Is this thing I’m about to do consistent with what I believe?</em> Or, better: <em>Is this the kind of thing the person I would like to be should do?</em></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The work of living is to set standards and then <em>not</em> compromise them. When you’re brushing your teeth, choosing your friends, losing your temper, falling in love, instructing your child, or walking your dog—all of these are opportunities.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Not, <em>I want to do good</em>—that’s an excuse. But, <em>I will do good in this particular instance, right now.</em> Set a standard; hold fast to it. That’s all there is.</p>
