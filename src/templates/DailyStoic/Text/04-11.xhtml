			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">W</span>hen people say change is good, they’re usually trying to reassure someone (or themselves). Because instinctively we view change as bad—or at least we’re suspicious of it.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The Stoics want you to do away with those labels altogether. Change isn’t good. The status quo isn’t bad. They just <em>are.</em></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Remember, events are objective. It’s only our opinion that says something is good or bad (and thus worth fighting against or fighting for). A better attitude? To decide to make the most of everything. But to do that you must first cease fighting.</p>
