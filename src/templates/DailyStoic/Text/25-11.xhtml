			<p class="x03-Chapter-Epigraph">“As for me, I would choose being sick over living in luxury, for being sick only harms the body, whereas luxury destroys both the body and the soul, causing weakness and incapacity in the body, and lack of control and cowardice in the soul. What’s more, luxury breeds injustice because it also breeds greediness.”</p>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text">And yet the most common response from a cancer survivor, the person who went through the thing we all dread and fear? “It was the best thing that ever happened to me.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Funny how that works out, isn’t it?</p>
