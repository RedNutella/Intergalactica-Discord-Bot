			<p class="x03-Chapter-Epigraph">“It is possible to curb your arrogance, to overcome pleasure and pain, to rise above your ambition, and to not be angry with stupid and ungrateful people—yes, even to care for them.”</p>

			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text-with-quote"><span class="_idGenDropcap-2">“I </span>was just born this way.” “I never learned anything different.” “My parents set a terrible example.” “Everyone else does it.” What are these? Excuses that people use to justify staying as they are instead of striving to become better.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Of course it’s possible to curb our arrogance, control our anger, and be a caring person. How do you think others do it? Certainly their parents weren’t perfect; they didn’t come out of the womb incapable of ego or immune to temptation. They worked on it. They made it a priority. They solved it like they would solve any other problem: by dedicating themselves to finding a solution, making incremental progress until they did.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">They <em>became</em> who they are. Just like you can.</p>
