			<p class="x03-Chapter-Epigraph">“Leave the past behind, let the grand design take care of the future, and instead only rightly guide the present to reverence and justice. Reverence so that you’ll love what you’ve been allotted, for nature brought you both to each other. Justice so that you’ll speak the truth freely and without evasion, and so that you’ll act only as the law and value of things require.”</p>

The two words are: persist and resist.” That’s great advice. But what principles should determine what we persist in and what we ought to resist?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Marcus supplies that answer: reverence and justice. In other words, virtue.</p>
