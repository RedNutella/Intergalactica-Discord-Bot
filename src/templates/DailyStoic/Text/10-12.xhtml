If you ever wondered why credit card companies and banks push cards so aggressively, this is why. The more credit cards you have, the more you’ll spend.</p>

Because we don’t exactly know how many days we’ll be alive, and because we try our hardest <em>not</em> to think about the fact that someday we’ll die, we’re pretty liberal with how freely we spend our time.
