			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">I</span>t’s never great to judge other people, but it’s worth taking a second to investigate how a life dedicated to indulging every whim actually works out.

Look at the dictator and his harem filled with plotting, manipulative mistresses. Look how quickly the partying of a young starlet turns to drug addiction and a stalled career.</p>
