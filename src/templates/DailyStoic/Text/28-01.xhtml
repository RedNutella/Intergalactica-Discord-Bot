			<p class="x03-Chapter-Epigraph">“Take a good hard look at people’s ruling principle, especially of the wise, what they run away from and what they seek out.”</p>

			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">S</span>eneca has said, “Without a ruler to do it against, you can’t make crooked straight.” That is the role of wise people in our lives—to serve as model and inspiration. To bounce our ideas off and test our presumptions.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Who that person will be for you is up to you. Perhaps it’s your father or your mother. Maybe it’s a philosopher or a writer or a thinker. Perhaps WWJD (What would Jesus do?) is the right model for you.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">But pick someone, watch what they do (and what they <em>don’t</em> do), and do your best to do the same.</p>
