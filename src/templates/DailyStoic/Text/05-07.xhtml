			<p class="x03-Chapter-Epigraph">“Good people will do what they find honorable to do, even if it requires hard work; they’ll do it even if it causes them injury; they’ll do it even if it will bring danger. Again, they won’t do what they find base, even if it brings wealth, pleasure, or power. Nothing will deter them from what is honorable, and nothing will lure them into what is base.”</p>

The same goes for your duty. If <em>anyone</em> could do it, it would have been assigned to someone else. But instead it was assigned to you.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Thankfully, you’re not like everyone. You’re not afraid of doing what is hard. You can resist superficially attractive rewards. Can’t you?</p>
